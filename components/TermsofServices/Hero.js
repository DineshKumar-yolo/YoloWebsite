            details, you are making an offer to us to buy a subscription. Your
            offer will only be accepted by us and a contract will be formed when
            we have successfully verified your payment details and email
            address, at which point we will provide you with access to your
            subscription. Company reserves the unfettered right to reject any
            offer made by its Users, at its discretion, for any or no reason.

            at that price, and we reserve the right to subsequently notify you
            of any pricing error. If we do this, you may cancel the
            subscription-based Service without any obligation to us and we will
            refund you any money you have paid us in full, or you may pay the
            correct price. If you refuse to exercise either of these choices
            then we may cancel your access to our subscription-based Services
            and will refund you any money you have paid us in full. The Company

            cancellation: You can choose a subscription-based Service of the
            term and duration offered by the Company as listed on the Site. Your
            subscription will renew automatically unless you cancel it before it
            renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the
            renewal term. We will notify you through SMS or email or both before

            subscription if you breach these Terms, with or without notice and
            without further obligation to you. We may also suspend or terminate
            your subscription if we are prevented from providing Services to you
            by circumstances beyond our control. The Company may, in exceptional
            circumstances, cease to publish the Site, the Site content or cease
            to provide subscription-based Services. The Company will give you at
            least 15 days' notice of this, if possible. If we do so, then we
            will have no further obligation on you except for a refund of the
            unexpired period of your paid subscription. This means that we will
            refund you with any amounts that you have paid us in advance that
            relate to any remaining and unexpired period of your subscription.
